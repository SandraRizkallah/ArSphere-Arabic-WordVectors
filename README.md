The file "ArSphere-Arabic-WordVectors50.txt" contains 39165 vectors for Arabic words. The vector dimension is 50. The vectors are generated using a new approach. The approach is based on embedding the word vectors into a sphere, whereby the dot product between any vectors represents the similarity. The file is organized as follows: each line contains the word followed by its vector where the vector's elements are comma delimited.
